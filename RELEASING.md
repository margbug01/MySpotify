# Releasing

1. Commit pending work and run `go test ./internal/...`.
2. Bump `version` in `mygo.json` in a commit titled just the version, e.g. `0.1.8`.
3. Tag it `v<version>` and push main and the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.8
   git push origin main v0.1.8
   ```

4. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds macOS, Windows and Linux and uploads them to a draft release. Wait for every job to pass:

   ```bash
   gh run watch "$(gh run list --workflow release.yml -L1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')" --exit-status
   ```

   If a job fails, don't publish; fix it first.

5. Publish the draft and mark it latest:

   ```bash
   gh release edit v0.1.8 --draft=false --latest
   ```

6. Check the update feed shows the new version:

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://github.com/egoist/mygo-cloudmusic/releases/latest/download/update-darwin-arm64.json
   ```

7. Deploy the website. It reads the latest release when it's prerendered, so it has to be rebuilt after publishing:

   ```bash
   cd website && bun run deploy
   ```

   Then check https://mygo-cloudmusic.egoist.workers.dev/download/ shows the new version.
